IP routing 
routing-
-it is process of sending packets from one network to other network(LAN and WAN
-This process is conducted by L3 device like router and L3 switch.
-routing helps to add unknown networks in routing table of router.

types of routing
1.static routing
-used in small network
-it is used when network admin knows destination address,gateway address
-route for destination network created by network admin

conf#ip route destination_network  dest_subnet_mask   Dest_gateway
R1
conf#ip route 172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0 180.0.0.2

R2
conf#ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 180.0.0.1



2.dynamic routing
-used in large network
-in this network admin does not know dest network address,gateway address
-it takes support of routing protocol which gives information about dest and gateway
-routing protocols are responsible to create path for destination.

There are two types of routing protocols

1.interior routing protocol
2.exterior routing protocol

Interior routing protocol

3 types-

1.distance vector---includes RIP(routing information protocol)

2.Link state---includes OSPF(open shortest path first)

3.Hybrid----EIGRP(enhanced interior gateway routing protocol)


Exterior routing protocols--
BGP(border gateway protocol)
 

Metrics in router
-----------------

Metrics represent group of parameters used by routing protocol to find out best path

1.hop count---less no of hop count in path,provides best way for dest
2.bandwidth(Mbps)---path with more bandwidth is best path
3.delay-----less delay in path to reach to destination is best way
4.load-----path with less load/traffic is best way
5.cost----maintainance cost of path.It is less for best path
6.Reliability----provides most trustable path
0-non reliable
255-relible 

Rip-hop count
eigrp-composite metric---delay,bandwidth,reliabilty,load
ospf-cost(bandwidth)

AD -Administrative distance

Low AD value provides best/trustable routing protocol
AD value is used by router when multiple routing methods are configured on it.

3.Hybrid-----includes EIGRP(enhanced interior gateway routing protocol)

Exterior routing protocol-

BGP-border gateway protocol

IS-IS-intersystem-intersystem

AD-administrative distance
it provides most trustable protocol to router to route packets
router use protocol with lowest AD value.It is used when multiple routing protocols  configured in router


directly connected-0
static-1
rip-120
ospf-110
eigrp-90
bgp external-20
bgp internal-200



Metrics-its set of parameters used by routing protocol to find out best path

following are the parameters

1.hop count-no of jumps taken by route to reach to destination.path with less hop count is called as best path 
2.delay-calculated in miliseconds,microseconds,nanoseconds
path will less delay is called as best path
3.bandwidth-calculated in Mbps,Gbps.Path with more bandwidth is called as best path
4.cost-It does not have any unit.it represent maintainance cost to repair that route.Path with less hop count called as best path
5.reliability-it defines accuracy in path.number 0 will not provide realibilty and number 255 provides high realibilty
